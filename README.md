# Voice controlled TODO list in React and Web Speech API

Experimental TODO list, which you can control with your voice.
## How to run it:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## How does it work?

When you press "Start" button, it asks first for the permission for the microphone. Afterwards, you can start saying commands:

- (new|another) task
- (complete|toggle) task [number]
  - number can be 1 - 5, one - five, first - fifth

The app talks back to you.
